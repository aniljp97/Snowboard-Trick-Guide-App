# Snowboard-Trick-Guide-App
Personal project to build a mobile app helpful to Snowboarders looking to progess their ability to do a variety of snowboard tricks. Made in Android Studio, written in Java.

# Purpose 
Give snowboard riders an simple app with the ability to retrieve the full proper name of a wide varitey of tricks by answering a series of simple questions. These questions are made so that a snowboarder with even the most basic knowledge of snowboard terminology will be able to understand and answer them properly. The tricks a user finds can be saved to 1 of 2 lists, a Tricks Completed List or a Tricks To Do List. This allows the user to see any tricks they have done or plan to do in a readable format. The tricks are fully editable and can be moved from list to list. There is also extra information that may be helpful to the user.

# Features
The questions and their answers that lead to a trick is based on this personally created tree, based on personal experience and online research. The tree contains questions, every answer the question has, where the answers lead to, and rules that can be applied to the trick name once the name is found. This tree is based fully created by myself and is subject to addition and change in the future.

# Conclusion
### Project State
Free of any bugs that I can find from personal testing on a Android Galaxy S20. This is a early version that can have many more additions:
* More complete amount of helpful information in the Info->Learn section.
* More settings that serve accessibilty, backing up data, switching between dark and light theme, etc.
* More interesting stats for the Info->Stats section.
* Possibly a Community section to allow users to share videos, tricks, tips, etc.
* Automatically generated notes about a trick that include a concise description of the trick when a trick is saved from finding one.
* More tricks and branches to the Trick Discovery Tree (the Other section which currently has nothing, and more).
* Introductory screen that quickly shows the user the apps features.

### Next Steps
In the process of publishing. Once published, can much futher test the app on different devices, any possible bugs, additions or fixes, which I add the Email Me button to allow for easy feedback to me. Once I recieve more feedback on this apps potential, I will decide if I should continue to add to it. 

But as of now, no known bugs present.
